**Redio Signals** introduces a new natural phenomenon into the game — rediowaves. With their help, you can transmit information over long distances, build complex mechanisms, and do many other things we won’t reveal just yet.

The exact nature of rediowaves is unknown. That’s why in this mod your task is to experiment, build hypotheses, test them, make mistakes, and gradually study the nature of this invisible carrier of information.

**The mod is currently in early beta, so most of the planned content hasn’t been implemented yet.**

To start studying rediowaves, use the starter guide:

1. **Encoder** converts a redstone signal into the _solid type_ of rediowaves, which can travel inside certain blocks (for example, copper blocks). The generated signal will propagate upwards.
2. **Decoder** can take the _solid type_ of rediowaves from nearby blocks and convert them back into up to three redstone signals.
3. With certain blocks, you can **convert** rediowaves from _solid type_ to _air type_ and vice versa. The picture below shows a simple setup for wireless redstone transmission using rediowaves.
4. Redioconductive blocks may affect rediowaves **differently**.

The exact list of blocks in which solid-type rediowaves can exist is unknown, so you are free to experiment and test different blocks for their redioconductivity.

**Note:** since the mod is still in beta, this list may be expanded and changed. In particular, the Chain is currently used as a converter from solid type to air type only temporarily.
